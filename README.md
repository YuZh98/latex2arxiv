**Validates arXiv compatibility and cleans your LaTeX project in one command — zip in, zip out.**

If you submit papers to arXiv, this tool is for you. Drop in a `.zip`, get a new arXiv-ready `.zip` back — your input is never overwritten — with pre-flight checks that catch submission-blocking issues before you upload.

```bash
latex2arxiv paper.zip --compile
```

Try the built-in demo:

```bash
pip install latex2arxiv
latex2arxiv --demo --compile
```

This processes a bundled self-documenting paper and opens the cleaned PDF. The cleaned demo's PDF is attached to every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/YuZh98/latex2arxiv/releases/latest) as `demo_project_arxiv.pdf` — see the output without installing.

## Who is this for?

- **You wrote your paper in Overleaf** and need a clean, arXiv-ready zip without manually pruning files. → [Overleaf → arXiv quickstart](docs/overleaf.md)
- **You want to gate a paper repo's CI on arXiv compliance** so a bad merge can't slip through. → `--dry-run` + non-zero exit on `[error]` ([details](#pre-flight-checks))
- **Your paper uses custom revision-tracking macros** (`\added`, `\deleted`, `\textcolor{red}{...}`) that you need stripped before submission. → [Custom removal rules](#custom-removal-rules---config)

## What it does

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 📦 **One-command zip-in / zip-out** | No directory dance, no manual repack; optionally compiles and opens the PDF for review |
| ✂️ **Prunes your project to submission-ready** | Keeps only files reachable from your main `.tex`; removes build artifacts, editor files, cover letters, unused figures |
| 🧹 **Cleans your `.tex`** | Strips comments, removes `\todo{}` / `\hl{}` / draft packages, handles nested braces correctly (`\deleted{see \cite{x}}` works) |
| 🚨 **Catches submission blockers before you upload** | `[error]` for shell-escape packages that will fail on arXiv (`minted`, `pythontex`); `[warn]` for biblatex without `.bbl`, missing index files, oversized output, problematic filenames — [full list](#pre-flight-checks) |

Also: BibTeX normalization, `\pdfoutput=1` injection, image resizing (Pillow), `--dry-run` preview, `--demo` for first-run.

Dependency tracking respects `\input`, `\include`, `\subfile`, `\includegraphics`, `\graphicspath`, and `\bibliography`. Commented-out commands are ignored.

## `latex2arxiv` vs. `arxiv_latex_cleaner`

[`arxiv_latex_cleaner`](https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner) is the incumbent in this space — Google-backed and mature. It cleans well, but it stops there: it won't tell you that `\usepackage{minted}` will fail on arXiv, won't produce the actual `.zip` you upload, and has no exit code for CI gating. `latex2arxiv` is built around catching the submission errors that bounce papers off arXiv — locally, before you upload — and emitting the upload-ready zip in one command.

### Where `latex2arxiv` is different

| ❌ Without `latex2arxiv` | ✅ With `latex2arxiv` |
|---|---|
| You upload, wait for arXiv to compile, get a cryptic failure email about `\usepackage{minted}`, re-upload and wait again. | Pre-flight checks catch it locally with a clear `[error]` message. Exits non-zero so your CI catches it too. |
| `arxiv_latex_cleaner` cleans into a directory — you still figure out what to zip, hope you didn't miss a `.bbl`. | The output *is* the file you upload. Nothing to figure out. |
| `\deleted{see \cite{smith}}` silently leaves `\cite{smith}` in your paper — PDF looks fine locally, reviewer sees a stray citation. | Brace-balanced matcher removes the whole nested expression correctly. |

### Where `arxiv_latex_cleaner` is stronger

| Advantage | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Maturity** | Thousands of papers cleaned, larger contributor pool, more edge cases discovered. |
| **Ghostscript-based PDF compression** | We don't bundle this. |
| **PNG → JPG conversion** | We don't do this. |

## Installation

```bash
pip install latex2arxiv
```

On macOS, if you get an `externally-managed-environment` error, use [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
brew install pipx
pipx install latex2arxiv
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuZh98/latex2arxiv
cd latex2arxiv
pip install .
```

`pdflatex` is required only for `--compile` (install via [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)).

Once installed, try the built-in demo to see the tool in action:

```bash
latex2arxiv --demo --compile
```

## Usage

```bash
latex2arxiv input.zip [output.zip] [--main MAIN_TEX] [--resize PX] [--config FILE] [--compile]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--main FILENAME` | Specify the main `.tex` file (e.g. `JASA_main.tex`). Auto-detected via `\documentclass` if omitted. |
| `--resize PX` | Resize images so longest side ≤ PX pixels (e.g. `--resize 1600`). Requires `Pillow`. |
| `--config FILE` | YAML config file for custom removal rules (see below). |
| `--compile` | Run `pdflatex` on the output and open the resulting PDF. |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be removed/processed without writing any output. |
| `--demo` | Run the built-in demo project (no input file needed). |

**Examples**

```bash
latex2arxiv paper.zip                                  # auto-detect main, basic conversion
latex2arxiv paper.zip out.zip --main main.tex --compile
latex2arxiv paper.zip --resize 1600 --compile          # shrink images
latex2arxiv paper.zip --config arxiv_config.yaml       # custom rules
latex2arxiv paper.zip --dry-run                        # preview without writing
latex2arxiv --demo --compile                           # run the built-in demo
```

## Pre-flight checks

Before producing the output zip, latex2arxiv validates the project against [arXiv's LaTeX submission guide](https://info.arxiv.org/help/submit_tex.html). `[error]` lines block submission (the tool exits non-zero, useful for CI gating); `[warn]` lines are advisory and do not affect the exit code.

Output on a project with several submission issues looks like this:

```text
$ latex2arxiv paper.zip --dry-run
  [error] \usepackage{minted} requires shell-escape — arXiv compiles without it; this submission will fail to build
  [error] \usepackage{psfig} — arXiv no longer supports the psfig package
  [warn]  \today used in \date — arXiv may rebuild the PDF and the date will change
  [warn]  .eps image found: photo.eps — pdflatex does not support .eps; convert to .pdf or .png
  [warn]  \printindex used but no .ind file at root — build locally and re-run latex2arxiv

Summary: 2 errors, 7 warnings
```

Either `[error]` line would have caused arXiv to reject the submission after upload. The exit code is non-zero on errors, so a CI step like `latex2arxiv paper.zip --dry-run` fails the build before the bad submission ever leaves the repo.

| Severity | Trigger | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 🛑 error | `\usepackage{minted}` / `pythontex` / `shellesc` | Require `--shell-escape`; arXiv compiles without it. |
| 🛑 error | `\usepackage{psfig}` | arXiv no longer supports the psfig package. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\usepackage{xr}` or `xr-hyper` | File paths/locations differ on arXiv; external-document references break. |
| ⚠️ warn | Main `.tex` not at the submission root | arXiv compiles from root; subdirectory main files aren't found. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\printindex` / `\printglossary` / `\printnomenclature` without matching `.ind` / `.gls` / `.nls` | arXiv doesn't run makeindex or glossary processors; the printed section silently disappears. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\usepackage{biblatex}` (or `\addbibresource`) without `<main>.bbl` shipped | If arXiv can't resolve any `.bib` file, your submission is blocked. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\documentclass[referee]` / `[doublespace]` / `\doublespacing` | arXiv requires single-spaced submissions. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\today` inside `\date{...}` | arXiv may rebuild the PDF; the date will change. |
| ⚠️ warn | `\subfile`'d document containing `\bibliographystyle` | Likely a standalone supplement; remove the `\subfile` line to avoid duplicate bibliography commands. |
| ⚠️ warn | `.eps` images shipped | `pdflatex` doesn't support `.eps`; convert to `.pdf` or `.png`. |
| ⚠️ warn | Custom `.cls` / `.sty` files | Verify they aren't already provided by TeX Live. |
| ⚠️ warn | Filename has spaces or non-ASCII characters | Breaks `\input` and `\includegraphics` resolution. |
| ⚠️ warn | Output `.zip` larger than 50 MB | arXiv has size limits; consider `--resize` or splitting supplementary materials. |

In addition to surfacing issues, the conversion silently fixes common pitfalls:

- Inserts `\pdfoutput=1` (or normalizes any `\pdfoutput=N`) in the main `.tex`, so arXiv selects pdfLaTeX.
- Preserves `00README` / `00README.XXX` files at root for arXiv processor hints.
- Strips comments and standard draft annotations (`\todo`, `\hl`, ...) and packages (`todonotes`, `comment`, ...).

## Custom removal rules (`--config`)

For revision markup and other project-specific cleanup, create a YAML config file. A template is in [`arxiv_config.yaml`](arxiv_config.yaml).

```yaml
# Remove command AND its argument (text is lost)
commands_to_delete:
  - \deleted
  - \revision

# Remove command but KEEP its argument text
commands_to_unwrap:
  - \color{red}       # \color{red}text → text
  - \textcolor{red}   # \textcolor{red}{text} → text
  - \added            # \added{new text} → new text

# Remove entire environments
environments_to_delete:
  - response

# Raw regex (last resort — prefer the verbs above when they fit).
# Recipe: any-color \textcolor → unwrapped text. Won't span nested
# commands like \cite — for those, use one commands_to_unwrap per color.
replacements:
  - pattern: '\\textcolor\{[^}]*\}\{([^}]*)\}'
    replacement: '\1'
```

The config parser is built in (no extra dependencies). The brace-balanced matcher correctly handles nested commands like `\deleted{see \cite{x}}`.

**Safety guarantees.** Unknown top-level keys warn — typos like `command_to_delete` (singular) no longer silently no-op. A malformed regex in any `replacements` rule emits a `[warn]` naming the rule's index, then skips just that rule; other rules still apply.

## CI / pre-commit integration

For paper repos under version control, you can wire the pre-flight check into a hook so a bad submission can't be merged.

### GitHub Action

The recommended path for paper repos. Drop this into a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/arxiv-check.yml`):

```yaml
name: arXiv pre-flight
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  arxiv-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: YuZh98/latex2arxiv@main  # pin to a release tag once one is published — see Releases
        with:
          input: paper/        # directory of .tex sources, or a .zip path
          main: main.tex       # optional; auto-detected from \documentclass
```

The action accepts a directory or a `.zip` for `input`. If a directory, it's zipped on the fly. By default it runs in `--dry-run` mode (no output written, but `[error]` lines fail the job). Set `dry-run: 'false'` to actually emit the cleaned zip — useful in a release workflow:

```yaml
      - uses: YuZh98/latex2arxiv@main
        id: clean
        with:
          input: paper/
          dry-run: 'false'
      - uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
        with:
          files: ${{ steps.clean.outputs.cleaned-zip }}
```

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | (required) | Path to the input — `.zip` file or directory of LaTeX sources. |
| `main` | (auto-detect) | Main `.tex` filename. |
| `config` | (none) | Path to a YAML config for custom removal rules. |
| `dry-run` | `'true'` | If `'false'`, emit the cleaned zip alongside the input. |
| `version` | (latest) | Pin a specific `latex2arxiv` version (e.g. `'0.6.0'`). |
| `python-version` | `'3.12'` | Python version used to install `latex2arxiv`. |

**Output:** `cleaned-zip` — path to the cleaned zip when `dry-run: 'false'` (empty otherwise).

### `pre-commit` hook

For repos that keep a built submission zip checked in:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/YuZh98/latex2arxiv
    rev: v0.6.0  # use a tagged release
    hooks:
      - id: latex2arxiv-dryrun
        files: paper\.zip$  # restrict to your submission zip
```

For paper repos that store `.tex` sources directly (the more common case), prefer the GitHub Action above — it can zip on the fly.

## Known limitations

**Dynamically constructed filenames** — `\includegraphics{\figpath/fig1}` cannot be resolved statically and the image will be deleted. Expand path macros before running.

**`\subfile` vs `\input` path resolution** — `\input`/`\include` paths resolve relative to the project root; `\subfile` paths resolve relative to the subfile's own directory. Unusual nested setups may cause images to be incorrectly pruned; use `--compile` to verify.

**Inline `\verb|...|`** — comment-stripping and draft-removal don't currently protect inline `\verb|...|`. A `%` or `\todo{...}` inside `\verb|...|` may get mangled. Standard `verbatim`, `lstlisting`, and `minted` *block* environments are protected.

**`--compile` is a local sanity check** — a successful local compile doesn't guarantee arXiv will compile it. arXiv pins specific TeX Live versions. Always check the [arXiv submission preview](https://arxiv.org/help/submit) after uploading.

[^main]: `JASA_main.tex` is identified as the main file via auto-detection (or pass `--main JASA_main.tex` to be explicit).
[^supp]: `Supplementary_Materials.tex` is kept because it's a `\subfile` dependency of the main file.
