# Overleaf → arXiv in 30 seconds

Most LaTeX papers live in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), and Overleaf's "Submit to arXiv" link doesn't actually clean your project — it just points you at the arXiv upload form. This guide takes you from an Overleaf project to an arXiv-ready upload in three steps, using `latex2arxiv` to do the cleaning and validation.

> **Why this matters:** Overleaf compiles with `-shell-escape` enabled by default. arXiv does not. So packages like `minted` and `pythontex` work in Overleaf and silently fail on arXiv — the kind of gotcha that costs you a 30-minute round-trip waiting for arXiv's rejection email. `latex2arxiv` catches it locally before you upload.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install latex2arxiv
```

(Python 3.10+. On macOS with `externally-managed-environment` errors, use [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/) instead — see the [main README](../README.md#installation).)

## Step 1 — Download your project as a `.zip` from Overleaf

In your Overleaf project:

1. Click the **Menu** button (top-left).
2. Under the **Download** section, click **Source**.

You'll get a `.zip` containing every file in your project — `.tex` files, figures, bibliographies, response letters, supplementary materials, the lot. That's exactly what `latex2arxiv` expects as input.

> **Tip:** Don't pick "PDF" — arXiv compiles your source itself, so the PDF download is the wrong thing. You want the **Source** zip.

## Step 2 — Run `latex2arxiv`

```bash
latex2arxiv my_project.zip --compile
```

This will:

1. **Auto-detect** your main `.tex` file via `\documentclass` (override with `--main main.tex` if needed).
2. **Prune** the project to only files reachable from the main `.tex` — drops cover letters, response letters, supplementary builds, editor backups, and unused figures.
3. **Clean** the source — strips comments, `\todo{}`, draft packages, normalizes BibTeX, injects `\pdfoutput=1`.
4. **Pre-flight check** — flags shell-escape packages, biblatex/`.bbl` mismatches, `.eps` images, and the [other arXiv submission gotchas](../README.md#pre-flight-checks). Errors exit non-zero.
5. **Compile** the cleaned project locally with `pdflatex` and open the resulting PDF for visual review.

You'll get back a `my_project_arxiv.zip` next to the input — your input is never overwritten.

If pre-flight reports `[error]` lines, fix them before uploading. Common ones for Overleaf users:

| Pre-flight error | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `\usepackage{minted} requires shell-escape` | Works in Overleaf, fails on arXiv | Replace with `listings` or pre-render code blocks |
| `\usepackage{psfig}` | Legacy, no longer supported | Switch to `graphicx`'s `\includegraphics` |
| `.eps image found` | `pdflatex` can't process `.eps` | Convert to `.pdf` (use `epstopdf`) |
| biblatex without `.bbl` shipped | arXiv often fails to resolve `.bib` files | Compile locally first; the `.bbl` will be picked up automatically on the next `latex2arxiv` run |

## Step 3 — Upload the cleaned `.zip` to arXiv

Go to [arxiv.org/submit](https://arxiv.org/submit), upload `my_project_arxiv.zip` as the source, and let arXiv's preview build it. If `latex2arxiv` exited cleanly (no `[error]` lines), the arXiv preview should compile on the first try.

Always check the [arXiv submission preview](https://arxiv.org/help/submit) PDF before submitting — `--compile` is a local sanity check, but arXiv pins specific TeX Live versions and edge cases occasionally slip through.

## Common Overleaf-specific situations

**Project uses a journal template (`elsarticle.cls`, `IEEEtran.cls`, etc.)**  
Most are already in TeX Live, so arXiv has them. `latex2arxiv` warns if you ship a custom `.cls` to make you double-check.

**Project uses `\subfile` for chapters or supplements**  
Supported. Dependency tracker handles `\subfile`. Watch for `\subfile`'d files containing `\bibliographystyle` — `latex2arxiv` warns about that case (it's a common cause of duplicate bibliography commands on arXiv).

**Project uses custom revision-tracking macros (`\added`, `\deleted`, `\textcolor{red}{...}`)**  
Use a YAML config to strip them on the way out. See [Custom removal rules](../README.md#custom-removal-rules---config) and the [`arxiv_config.yaml`](../arxiv_config.yaml) template.

**Project uses biblatex + biber**  
Supported. `latex2arxiv --compile` detects `\usepackage{biblatex}` or `\addbibresource` and runs `biber` instead of `bibtex`. arXiv compiles biblatex projects too as long as you ship a `.bbl` (or your project still resolves the `.bib`).

**Overleaf project has `__MACOSX/` and `.DS_Store` files**  
If you ever round-trip through macOS Finder, those folders end up in the zip. `latex2arxiv` ignores them.

## Putting it in a script

For repeat submissions (revisions, multiple papers), make it one command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# arxiv-prep.sh
set -e
latex2arxiv "$1" --compile
echo "→ Cleaned zip ready: ${1%.zip}_arxiv.zip"
```

Then: `./arxiv-prep.sh my_project.zip`.
